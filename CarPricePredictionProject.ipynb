        "\n",
        "In this project, the goal is to predict car prices based on inputs/specifications of a car. For example, the model that we build, should be able to correctly tell the price of a car if provided with model, make, year, mileage, and other important characteristics of a car. This is an important problem for many car resale businesses.\n",

        "predictions. This involves testing model performance on unknown data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "4 Then we implement a linear regression model in Python and NumPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 Next, we cover feature engineering to extract important features from the data\n",
        "to improve the model.\n",
