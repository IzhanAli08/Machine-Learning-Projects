        "For example, I am interested in predicting car prices. I will collect data from my neighbors asking them their car prices. I will also note down various attributes of their cars (for example their make, model, specifications etc.). These attributes impact car prices therefore these can be used to create a mathematical model (consider this as a black-box) by training (teching) the model this relationship between attributes and prices. Once the model has learnt the relationship it can output the approximate price of any new car given its attributes.\n",
