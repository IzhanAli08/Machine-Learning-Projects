In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture turns a pale golden brown.\\n2. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream, a little at a time, until fully combined.\\n3. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.\\n4. Stir in the Parmesan and Gruyère cheeses, salt, and pepper.\\n\\n**Cook the Pasta:**\\n\\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\\n2. Add the fettuccine and cook according to package directions, or until al dente (slightly firm to the bite).\\n\\n**Assemble the Dish:**\\n\\n1. Drain the pasta and add it to the Alfredo sauce.\\n2. Stir to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.\\n3. Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* For a richer flavor, use freshly grated Parmesan cheese.\\n* Add a dash of nutmeg or garlic powder to the sauce for extra seasoning.\\n* If the sauce is too thick, add a little more heavy cream.\\n* Serve with a side of crusty bread for dipping.\"\n",
